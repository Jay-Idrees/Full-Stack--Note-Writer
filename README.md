# Full-Stack Note Writer

## About the Project
This project is a full-stack application that allows a user to create a sticky note for writing notes. Each of the note has a unique id and the contents are stored in a database which is a JSON file. This application couples Front-End HTML Bootstrap webpage with a backend database called db in JSON format. I developed this application during the third week of the coding bootcamp experience at Columbia University, NY. Date of publication: 11/01/2020

## User Story

As a user I want to be able to write and save notes. The app should have the ability to delete notes I have written before so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete and can save pertinent information.
